                  <p>JobKeeper and JobSeeker are very different things but some marketing genius in the PM’s office thought it was a brilliant idea to give them similar names, for a little extra confusion.</p>
                  <p><em>Jobkeeper</em></p>
                  <p>Is a wage subsidy paid to workplaces (employers), which they have to pass entirely on to workers (employees). It is not welfare or a Centrelink benefit. It is paid to workplaces by the ATO. JobKeeper was introduced by the Government as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. </p>
                  <p><em>Jobseeker</em></p>
                  <p>Is a Centrelink welfare benefit and previously known as NewStart or colloquially known as the dole. It was designed before the COVID-19 crisis however has been modified slightly as a response to COVID-19. Anyone who qualifies for JobSeeker will also receive the Coronavirus Supplement, which is an extra $550 per fortnight. The Government has relaxed the rules slightly, which means you don’t have to be actively seeking work as intensely as you would have previously been required - in recognition that it’s actually quite hard to find work in the current environment. </p>

                    <li>If you normally receive <em>$1,500 or more per fortnight</em> (before tax), you will continue to receive your regular income from your workplace, so long as you continue to work the same amount. The JobKeeper payment will simply provide a subsidy to your workplace.</li>
                    <li>If you normally receive <em>less than $1,500 per fortnight</em> (before tax), your workplace must pay you, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax). There is a chance your workplace will make you work more hours in this case. If you start to work more than $1,500 worth per fortnight, you have to be paid extra from your workplace.</li>
                    <li>If you <em>have been stood down (and remain stood down)</em>, your employer must pay you, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax). If you remain stood down, you do not have to work to receive the $1,500 but must go back to work as soon as the crisis stops impacting your work.</li>
                    <li>If you <em>were employed on 1 March 2020, and then ceased employment due to the crisis</em>, and then were re-hired by the same employer, you will receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The $1,500 payment is paid to your workplace (employer) and your workplace will have to pay you as they regularly would, through the normal payroll process. This includes superannuation payments.</p>
                  <h4>Freelancers, artists, self-employed or in the gig economy:</h4>
                  <p>If you fall into this category (operate under an ABN) you will receive the $1,500 payment from the ATO (after submitting your JobKeeper application online) to your nominated bank account.</p>
