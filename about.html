          <p>Watching the Covid-19 crisis snowball around the world, it was clear that before long Australia would be seeing similar events unfold on its home soil. Within the space of a week - what was all she’ll be right here in Australia, was soon mass stand-downs, friends losing work and ordinary people stuck in quarantine.</p>
          <p>The gravity of the situation was not lost on Tristan, who quickly leapt to his wider network’s assistance. Having specialised in getting his way with Centrelink since '08 and understanding the language of government - he offered to use his fortnightly day off, to help all those who had been impacted by the crisis to navigate the administrative bureaucratic nightmare known as Centrelink.</p>
          <p>It wasn’t long before he was inundated with hundreds of messages and emails from old classmates, family friends, ex-housemates’ siblings and so on. The need for simple, easy to understand information in relation to welfare entitlements during such a time, became profound.</p>
          <p>Tristan and his friends; Xavier and Sam quickly decided to combine their distinct yet complementary skills to create a website and chatbot to help answer some of these questions that so many people in Australia clearly have.</p>
          <p>You might not speak the language of government, but we can assure you that welfare is not a dirty word in any language. Welfare is a right and no one should be put off applying for it because of administrative hurdles or stigma.</p>
