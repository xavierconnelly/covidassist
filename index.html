                  <ol class="number">
                    <li>Go online and <a href="https://my.gov.au/LoginServices/main/login?execution=e1s1">log in</a> to your existing MyGov account or <a href="https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/online-help/create-mygov-account">create a new one.</a></li>

                      <p>If you have received Centrelink payments in the past, including as a young person or while studying, and have a MyGov and Centrelink account linked, jump to step four.</p>
                      <p>Once you log in to MyGov account, you can “register your intent to claim” a Centrelink payment.</p>
                      <p>The only information you need at this stage is your MyGov login. Services Australia (Centrelink) will call you to arrange next steps.</p>
                      <p>If you register between 23 and 29 March 2020, your payment will start from 23 March 2020, if you submit your full claim by 19 April 2020.</p>
                      <p>If you register from 30 March 2020 your payment will start from the date you registered your intention to claim, if your claim is accepted.</p>
                      <p>More information about how to register your intent to claim can be found on the <a href="https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/affected-coronavirus-covid-19/if-you-need-payment-coronavirus-covid-19/register-your-intention-claim-payment-coronavirus-covid-19">Services Australia page.</a></p>

                      <p>Once you have clicked “registered your intent to claim” with Centrelink, Centrelink will contact you to confirm your identity. They will give you your Customer Reference Number (CRN) and a linking code. You’ll need these to set up access to your Centrelink online account.</p> 
                      <p>When they contact you, you’ll need to give them proof of your identity.</p>

                        <li>You will need to select the section that says “Looking for work” (unless you are a student).</li>
                        <li>This will have you apply for JobSeeker. Find out more about the <a href="">JobSeeker and Coronavirus supplement</a>. If you are a student or apprentice, select the relevant section.</li>
                        <li>You'll have to submit any required documents online now, but you'll have 14 days to submit any supplementary documents.</li>

                    <li>
                      <p>As part of the claim, you may need to book a phone appointment. Some people have reported problems with the website at this point (among others).</p>
                      <p>You'll need to make a note of your appointment time and make sure your phone is with you.</p>
                      <p>They'll call from a private number. Answer it!</p>

                      <p>Wait. Centrelink will let you know if your claim has been approved.</p>
                      <p>If it is, they'll tell you when you need to report to them, and how.</p>
                      <p>This may come through your MyGov inbox or the Express Plus Centrelink app (if you've downloaded it) or by post.</p>
                      <p>Reporting just means letting Centrelink know how much money you earned over the past 14 days and confirming you've stuck to the mutual obligations laid out in your job plan.</p>
                      <p>You'll have to report every two weeks.</p>
                      <p>If you don't report, you won't get paid. If you're late reporting, your payment will be late.</p>
                      <p>You can report online or over the phone.</p>

                  <p>JobKeeper and JobSeeker are very different things but some marketing genius in the PM’s office thought it was a brilliant idea to give them similar names, for a little extra confusion.</p>
                  <p><em>JobKeeper</em> is a wage subsidy paid to workplaces (employers), which they have to pass entirely on to workers (employees). It is not welfare or a Centrelink benefit. It is paid to workplaces by the ATO. JobKeeper was introduced by the Government as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. </p>
                  <p><em>JobSeeker</em>is a Centrelink welfare benefit and previously known as NewStart or colloquially known as the dole. It was designed before the COVID-19 crisis however has been modified slightly as a response to COVID-19. Anyone who qualifies for JobSeeker will also receive the Coronavirus Supplement, which is an extra $550 per fortnight. The Government has relaxed the rules slightly, which means you don’t have to be actively seeking work as intensely as you would have previously been required - in recognition that it’s actually quite hard to find work in the current environment. </p>

                        <li>For some workers (such as casuals or part-time employees, especially those in lower paid industries) the JobKeeper payment is potentially more than they would usually earn as you have to be paid the full $1,500 per fortnight.</li>
                        <li>This keeps you in contact in a relationship with your employer and therefore once the crisis is over, you will likely start to resume a normal employment relationship.</li>
                        <li>You will continue to receive all the employee entitlements such as superannuation and leave.</li>
                        <li>It may help keep your employer’s business viable by participating in the JobKeeper program.</li>

                    <li>The payment is higher than any Centrelink payments so it is also taxed slightly more. However this is a minor point and not considered to be important in making your decision.</li>
