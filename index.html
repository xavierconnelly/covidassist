                  <p>To prove that you have faced a 30% fall in revenue, you need to show that your revenue has fallen relative to your revenue in the same month a year earlier. This can also be changed to a 3 month window, if your revenue is less consistent. So compare 3 months to 3 months.</p>
                  <p>If you have not been operating as a sole-trader for 12 months or more, or if your turnover a year earlier was not representative of your usual or average revenue, the Tax Commissioner will have discretion to consider additional information that you can provide to establish that you have been adversely affected by the impacts of the Coronavirus.</p>
                  <p>This means that if you can still apply if you have been operating for less than 12 months - but may be required to show some other evidence later down the track.</p>
                  <p>There will be some tolerance where, in good faith, you estimate a 30% or greater fall in turnover but actually experience a slightly smaller fall.</p>

                    <li>If you were employed on 1 March 2020, and then ceased employment due to the crisis, and then were re-hired by the same employer, you will receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The $1,500 payment is paid to your workplace (employer) and your workplace will have to pay you as they regularly would, through the normal payroll process. This includes superannuation payments.</p>

                  <p>If you fall into this category (operate under an ABN) you will receive the $1,500 payment from the ATO (after submitting your JobKeeper application online) to your nominated bank account.<p>
